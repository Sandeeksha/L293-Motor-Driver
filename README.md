## ‚öôÔ∏è Circuit Description

- **Input Power:**
  - External voltage is supplied via connector `J2`.
  - The **7805 voltage regulator** (`U2`) regulates the voltage down to **5V** for logic operation and powering low-power peripherals.
- **Motor Driver (L293D):**
  - The `L293D` (`U1`) is a dual H-bridge motor driver IC used to drive two DC motors independently.
  - Control inputs for the motor driver are provided through connector `J1` (4-pin header).
- **Outputs:**
  - Motor outputs are available at connectors `J3` and `J4`, each controlling one motor.
- **Status Indication:**
  - An LED (`D1`) with a current-limiting resistor (`R1`) is used to indicate that the 5V regulated power is available.
- **Power Flags:**
  - `PWR_FLAG` symbols are added for validation to indicate power availability in schematic design tools.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. External power is connected to the circuit through `J2`.
2. `U2` (7805) steps down the input voltage to 5V DC to power the logic circuitry.
3. Control signals (e.g., PWM, direction control) are provided to `J1`.
4. `U1` (L293D) uses these signals to drive two motors connected via `J3` and `J4`.
5. The LED (`D1`) lights up to indicate that 5V regulated power is available and the system is active.


 ## üöÄ How to Use

- Connect a DC input voltage to **J2**.
- Connect control signals (motor directions) to **J1**.
- Connect your DC motors to **J3** and **J4**.
- Power up and control your motors!
